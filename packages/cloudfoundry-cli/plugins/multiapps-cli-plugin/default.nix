      This is a Cloud Foundry CLI plugin (formerly known as CF MTA Plugin) for performing
      operations on
      [Multitarget Applications (MTAs)](<https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/09/66d96898-fa7d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html>)
      in Cloud Foundry, such as deploying, removing, viewing, etc. It is a client for the
      [CF MultiApps Controller](<https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-controller>)
      (known also as CF MTA Deploy Service), which is an MTA deployer implementation for Cloud
      Foundry. The business logic and actual processing of MTAs happens into
      CF MultiApps Controller backend.
